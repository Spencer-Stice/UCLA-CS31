This program prints a "staircase" of the # character where the top of the staircase is the top left and the bottom is the bottom right where the number of rows is the same as the input number and the final row has the same number of #'s as the input number (alternatively, it prints a triangle of the # character in the same manner starting with one #, having the same number of rows as the input integer, and the last row having the same number of #'s as the input number).
